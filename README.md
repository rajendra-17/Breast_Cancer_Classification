# Breast Cancer Classification Using Neural Networks

This repository contains a project on breast cancer classification using neural networks. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on several features extracted from medical data. The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92%.

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project uses a neural network to classify breast cancer tumors using features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided as a CSV file (`breast_cancer_data.csv`). It contains several features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. Each row in the dataset represents a sample, and each sample is labeled as either benign (0) or malignant (1).

## Model

The neural network model developed for this project consists of:

- Input Layer: Accepts multiple features extracted from the dataset.
- Hidden Layers: Several fully connected layers with activation functions to capture complex patterns in the data.
- Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Performance

The model was trained and validated on the dataset, achieving a final accuracy of around 92%. The performance of the model was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
